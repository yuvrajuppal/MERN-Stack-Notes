### What is Bcrypt?
Bcrypt is a hashing function designed specifically for passwords. It has two key features:
1. **Salting:** It adds a random string (the "salt") to the password before hashing it. This ensures that two users with the same password ("password123") will have completely different hashes in your database.
2. **Cost Factor (Work Factor):** It is intentionally slow. It performs multiple "rounds" of hashing to make "brute-force" attacks (where a hacker tries millions of combinations) painfully slow and expensive.

### Implementation Example
In a real app, you use bcrypt during **Signup** (to hash) and **Login** (to compare).
#### 1. Hashing a Password (Signup)

When a user creates an account, you hash their password before saving it to MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.

```js
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
const signup = async (password) => {
    const saltRounds = 10; // The "Cost Factor" - 10 is the industry standard
    
    // Generate salt and hash in one go
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
    
    console.log("Original:", password);
    console.log("Hashed to save in DB:", hashedPassword);
    return hashedPassword;
};
signup("my_secret_password_123");
```

#### 2. Comparing a Password (Login)

Bcrypt hashes are "one-way"—you cannot "un-hash" them. To check a login, you take the user's input and compare it against the hash in your database using `bcrypt.compare()`.

```js
const login = async (inputPassword, storedHash) => {
    // bcrypt handles extracting the salt from the hash automatically
    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, storedHash);

    if (isMatch) {
        console.log("Login Successful! You can now issue a JWT.");
    } else {
        console.log("Invalid Password.");
    }
};
```


### Why use `saltRounds = 10`?
The number of rounds determines how many times the hashing algorithm runs.
- **Too low (e.g., 4):** Fast, but easier for hackers to crack.
- **Too high (e.g., 15):** Very secure, but will make your server slow and laggy every time someone logs in.
- **Sweet Spot:** **10 to 12** is currently considered the best balance for modern servers in 2026.
