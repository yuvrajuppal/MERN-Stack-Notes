## What is an object?

A JavaScript object is a collection of key-value pairs, where:
- Each key (also called a property name) is a string (or symbol).
- Each value can be any data type: number, string, boolean, array, function, or even another object.

```js
const person = {
	firstName: "John",
	lastName: "Doe",
	age: 30,
	city: "New York",
	skills:["js","python"],
	balance:{bank:"1000$",cash:"100$"}
};
console.log(person.firstName); // "John"
console.log(person["city"]); // "New York"
```

## Get list of Object keys
