let,var,const are keywords that are uses to declare variables 
```js
let name = "yuvraj"
var email = "yuvraj@gmail.com"
const number = 1234567890
```

you cannot assign new value to const 
```js
const number = 1234567890
number = 7890 // error will come 
```

in let and var  u can re assign the value to the variable
```js
let number = 1234567890
number = 7890 // error will not come 
```

```js
var number = 1234567890
number = 7890 // error will not come 
```

right now don't use var 
use let and const only
