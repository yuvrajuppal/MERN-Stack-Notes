The `for...in` loop in JavaScript iterates over enumerable properties (keys) of an object, including inherited ones from prototypes.[](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_forin.asp)​
```js
for (let key in object) {
  // code block
}
```

```js
const person = {name: "Alice", age: 30};
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key, person[key]);  // "name" "Alice", "age" 30
}

const arr = [10, 20];
for (let i in arr) {
  console.log(i, arr[i]);  // "0" 10, "1" 20 (indices as strings)
}
```
