A closure in JavaScript is a function that “remembers” and has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after that outer function has finished running.

```js
const createcounter =()=>{
	let counter = 0
	const increament = ()=>{
		counter++
	}
	const getcounter = ()=>{
		return counter
	}
	return{increament,getcounter}
}
const counter =createcounter();

counter.increament()
counter.increament()
counter.increament()
counter.increament()
counter.increament()
counter.increament()  

console.log(counter.getcounter());
```
