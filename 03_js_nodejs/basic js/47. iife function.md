An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined, without needing a separate call like `myFunction()`.
```js
(function () {
  // code runs immediately
})();

```

```js
(() => {
  // code runs immediately
})();

```



## Async IIFE (for `async`/`await`)
In modern code, you’ll often see an async IIFE when you need `await` at the top level (before top-level `await` was supported)

```js
(async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})(); // Immediately runs this async function

```
