CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes a webpage look nice: it controls colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and effects.
In short:
- HTML = the content and structure (like headings, paragraphs, buttons).
- CSS = the style (how that content looks on screen).
So, CSS is the language that tells the browser how to display HTML elements — like making a button blue, centering text, or creating a multi‑column layout.
